# Required Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
The goal of this assignment was to use our learnings so far to determine the characteristics
of drivers who accepted coupons versus those who did not. I focused my independent
investigation on coupons for coffee houses, as well as on coupons accepted by driver
over 50 years of age.

## Relevant Files
- The Jupyter notebook used for the analysis can be found [here](assignment.ipynb).
- The CSV file referenced by it can be found [here](data/coupons.csv).
- The images of the figures generated as part of the analysis can be [here](images/).
- The non-technical report can be found [here](report.rtf).

## Summary of Findings
Drivers are more likely to accept the coffee house coupons when:
- driving to no urgent place, as opposed to work or home.
- driving with friends or their partner, as opposed to alone or with their kids.
- the temperature is 80F, compared to 30F or 55F.
- the coupon is valid for a full day, as opposed to only two hours.
- they are single or divorced, rather than partnered or widowed.
- driving in the same direction as the coffee house.
- they are within 5 to 15 minutes from the coffee house.
- it is the late morning or early afternoon (10 AM or 2 PM), as opposed to early in
the morning (7 AM) or later in the day (6 PM or 10 PM).
- they are below 30 years of age, with the highest likehood being when they are under
the age of 21.
- they have visited a coffeehouse before.

Certain factors like the weather & the drivers' parental status seem to have little
to no impact on coffee house coupon acceptance.

Drivers above the age of 50 are more likely to accept coupons for:
- carry out & take away
- inexpensive restaurants
